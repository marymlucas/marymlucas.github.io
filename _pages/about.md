I am a PhD student in Information Science at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/cci/) College of Computing and Informatics where I'm advised by [Prof Christopher Yang](http://cci.drexel.edu/faculty/cyang/). My research interests and work lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence / machine learning and healthcare.  In particular, I'm interested in predictive modelling, AI bias and fairness, and health disparities/equity. I bring to this work many years of clinical experience as an emergency and trauma registered nurse working both in the US and in New Zealand.

I'm also affiliated with the [Boston University Health Informatics Research Lab (MET College)](https://www.bu.edu/met/). 

Prior to my experience in the healthcare field I taught undergraduate and graduate level Physics, and hold a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) degree in Physics.
