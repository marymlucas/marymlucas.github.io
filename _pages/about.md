I am a doctoral candidate and graduate research assistant at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/cci/){:target="_blank"} College of Computing and Informatics where I'm advised by [Prof Christopher Yang](http://cci.drexel.edu/faculty/cyang/){:target="_blank"} in the Health Informatics Research Group. 

My [research interests](/research/) and work lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence / machine learning and healthcare. I bring to this work many years of clinical experience as a registered nurse in emergency and trauma settings in the US and in New Zealand.

Prior to venturing into the healthcare field I taught undergraduate and graduate level Physics, and hold a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) degree in Physics.
