I'm Mary Lucas and I'm a PhD student in Information Science at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/cci/) College of Computing and Informatics. I am advised by [Prof Christopher Yang](http://cci.drexel.edu/faculty/cyang/) and my research interests and work lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence / machine learning and healthcare.  In particular, I am interested in predictive modelling, AI bias and fairness, and health disparities research. I bring to this work many years of experience in clinical settings as a registered nurse working in ER and trauma settings both in the US and in New Zealand. 

I am also affiliated with the [Boston University Health Informatics Research Lab (MET College)](https://www.bu.edu/met/). 

Prior to working in the healthcare field I taught undergraduate and graduate level Physics and hold a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) degree in Physics.
