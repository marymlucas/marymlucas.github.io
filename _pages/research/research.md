My research interests fall broadly within health informatics, artificial intelligence in medicine, and health equity. My work is primarily focused on two key areas:

1. **Bias in health AI** 
  - developing frameworks and approaches to define, detect, and quantify AI bias
  - exploring and creating innovative approaches to mitigate AI bias and unfair outcomes
  - examining the role of AI on health disparities
  - using AI to advance health equity

2. **Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare** 
  - exploring novel healthcare applications
  - evaluating clinical effectiveness and safety
  - understanding the implications of LLMs in clinical settings

While I'm passionate about advancing technological frontiers with novel methods and approaches, my work is grounded in pragmatism. I believe that meaningful research must bridge the gap between innovative methodologies and tangible improvements in health outcomes. My ultimate hope is that my work will advance science in a way that makes a real difference in people's lives, improves health outcomes, and reduces health disparities.
