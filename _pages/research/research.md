My research falls into the broad area of health informatics, and more specifically health AI. I am currently interested in:

  1. AI bias in the healthcare context - how to define it, detect it, quantify it, and mitigate it. Foundational to this is my interest and work in health equity.

  2. Large Language Models (LLMs) in the healthcare context - applications, evaluation, and potential issues/concerns.

I strive to approach my work and research from a pragmatic stance, with the strong belief that while novel methods and approaches are exciting and worthy of deep exploration, the most important work I can do in the world is that which makes an actual difference in health outcomes and in people's lives. 

Here is a current list of [research projects](/) that I have or am working on, as well as a list of my current [publications](/research/publications/).
