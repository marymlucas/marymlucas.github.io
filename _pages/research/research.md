My research interests fall broadly within health informatics, artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, and health equity. My work is currently focused on four key areas:

1. **Health AI**
  - predictive modeling using all forms of health data
  - examining the role of AI in health disparities
  - using AI to advance health equity

2. **Health Disparities**
  - identifying and quantifying health disparities using EHR data
  - understanding causes of disparities
  - exploring measures to mitigate / eliminate disparities and advance health equity

3. **AI Bias (with a specific focus on health AI)** 
  - developing frameworks and approaches to define, detect, and quantify AI bias
  - exploring and creating innovative approaches to reduce / mitigate AI bias and unfair outcomes


4. **Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare** 
  - exploring novel healthcare applications
  - evaluating clinical effectiveness and safety
  - understanding the implications of LLMs in clinical settings

While I am passionate about advancing technological frontiers with novel methods and approaches, my work is grounded in pragmatism. I believe that meaningful research must bridge the gap between innovative methodologies and tangible improvements in health outcomes. My hope is that my work will contribute to scientific advancements in ways that improve health outcomes, reduce disparities, and positively impact individuals and communities.
