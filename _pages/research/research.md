My research work falls into the broad area of health informatics, and more specifically health AI. I am interested particularly in AI bias - how to define it in the healthcare context, how to detect it, how to quantify it, and how to mitigate it. Foundational to this is my interest and work in health equity.

I strive to approach my work and research from a pragmatic stance, with the strong belief that while novel methods and approaches are exciting and worthy of deep exploration, the most important work I can do in the world is work that makes an actual difference in health outcomes and in people's lives. 

Here is a current list of research projects that I have or am working on, as well as a list of my current [publications](/_pages/publications.md).
