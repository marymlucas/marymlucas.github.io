## Research Philosophy
My work is grounded in pragmatic innovation. I focus on advancing methodological research in artificial intelligence while ensuring that new approaches translate into measurable improvements in health outcomes. My goal is to bridge cutting-edge AI methods with real-world clinical impact - developing solutions that improve decision-making, reduce disparities, and meaningfully benefit patient communities.

## Core Focus Areas

- **Health AI & Predictive Modeling**  
  Developing robust predictive models using multi-modal health data to support clinical decision-making.

- **Algorithmic Fairness & Bias**  
  Designing novel frameworks to detect, quantify, and mitigate bias in high-stakes clinical AI systems.

- **Health Disparities**  
  Using large-scale EHR and registry data to quantify systemic inequities and evaluate real-world care pathways.

- **Clinical LLMs**  
  Evaluating and improving the safety, reliability, and reasoning performance of Large Language Models in healthcare.

## Selected Projects

### Reliable and Robust Clinical AI  
*Algorithmic Fairness & Uncertainty Quantification*

- Designed a fairness auditing framework for clinical risk prediction models across chronic kidney disease, substance use disorder, and oncology datasets, integrating novel mitigation techniques and benchmarking against existing approaches ([JCO CCI↗](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/CCI.23.00194), [AIME 2025↗](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95841-0_44), [IEEE ICHI 2024↗](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10628594), [IEEE ICHI 2023↗](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI57859.2023.00128)).
- Leveraged over 10 years of clinical nursing experience to guide feature engineering and problem formulation, distinguishing true physiological signal from artifacts of clinical workflow.
- Quantified disparities in readmission prediction and treatment completion, demonstrating how commonly used fairness metrics fail to capture systemic healthcare inequities.
- Developed a **Neighborhood-Adaptive Difficulty Score** combining k-nearest neighbor topology with conformal prediction to distinguish model limitations from inherent case complexity. <br>*Manuscript in preparation*

### Real-World Evidence & Health Disparities Modeling

- Developed a mixed-order Markov chain simulation using VA Corporate Data Warehouse data to model prostate cancer treatment sequences and identify empirically observed pathways associated with elevated mortality risk across racial groups. <br>*Manuscript in preparation*
- Conducted a national registry study using the AAO IRIS® Registry to quantify racial and gender disparities in retinal vein occlusion treatment via multivariable logistic regression, highlighting inequities in access to anti-VEGF therapy ([Ophthalmology Retina↗](https://www.ophthalmologyretina.org/article/S2468-6530(24)00043-5/abstract)).

### Clinical NLP & Large Language Model Evaluation

- Developed **Ensemble Reasoning**, an iterative prompting framework that improved medical question-answering accuracy and consistency on USMLE datasets (+3-5%) across both closed (GPT-4) and open-source clinical LLMs ([JAMIA↗](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/31/9/1964/7705627)).
- Applied open-source clinical LLMs to extract **pathologic TNM cancer stage** from real-world pathology reports without labeled training data, demonstrating that prompting and ensemble-based reasoning can achieve competitive performance and improved consistency relative to fine-tuned BERT baselines ([AIME 2024↗](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-66538-7_23), [IEEE ICHI 2024 →](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10628943)).
- Designed and evaluated an LLM-assisted pipeline to automate extraction of population demographics from biomedical literature, enabling scalable equity analysis ([International Journal of Digital Curation↗](https://ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/950)).
